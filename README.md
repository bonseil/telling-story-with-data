## Project description

One of humanity’s fundamental features is the innate ability to employ tools to work smarter, not harder. We benefit from those innovations in our everyday lives, from the way that we engage with one another, to everyday tasks. 

As our knowledge base has grown, our ability to craft mechanical devices for our aid grew exponentially. The robots of today are employed for a variety of reasons, from the farm to space and beyond. As these robots become increasingly accessible, they’ve made their way into the kitchen as well.

We have decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so have decided to try to attract investors. I am doing market research to better understand the current market conditions
and how to best position our restaurant to revolutionize. So exciting!
